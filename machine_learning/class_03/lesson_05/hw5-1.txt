a) What is the output shape of the second Conv2D() layer?
24, 24, 32

b) How many parameters are there in the second Conv2D() layer?
4640

c) Assuming your model uses single precision (32-bit floating point numbers) for parameters, what will be the size of the second Conv2D() layer in bytes?
18,560

d) When we look at the size of mnist-optimizer/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00001, we see the following file sizes for the 3 optimizers:
sgd: 2,388,926
rmsprop: 4,774,349
adam: 7,159,495
Why would the size of a model trained with optimizer="rmsprop" be about twice the size of the model trained with optimizer="sgd"?

RMSprop uses a squared moving average of the gradient and SGD uses the moving average of the gradient. I imagine the numbers might be larger (occupy more bytes because more decimal places) and require more space to hold when using a function that squares the gradient.
