Assignment: Leveraging LDAP as an Attacker

As an attacker, how can you leverage LDAP to your advantage? Give at least 3 examples and describe in detail.
1. As LDAP allows common CRUD uses, you could create a new device on LDAP for which another authenticated user could connect. This new machine could point to an external IP address, while as an LDAP resource, it is still considered to be an internal resource. If this is not possible to create a new device, port forwarding can be set up to eavesdrop on the communication (https://www.praetorian.com/blog/how-to-exploit-active-directory-acl-attack-paths-through-ldap-relaying-attacks/)
2. LDAP is a directory of all resources on a specific domain, and could be enormously valuable in recon as it could allow you to see what can be attacked. Enumerating via the built-in LDAP functionality would allow an attacker to discover potentially high-privelege actors (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njjwUoeOwhY&ab_channel=StealthbitsnowpartofNetwrix). And without appropriate configurations in place, an attacker could perform a password spray on all of the users and potentially gain access to weak password protected accounts (https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/getting-inside-mind-attacker-part-2-external-attacks-active-directory)
3. A DOS attack could be performed against all the users on the LDAP network by sending a request to the LDAP system, with a spoofed IP. For example, an attacker could send a packet to LDAP saying it is 1.1.1.1, which is a legitament user on the LDAP network, and LDAP would respond to that user rather than the actual origin (attacker). Replicate this attack multiple times and the problem could compound itself to a user on the network not asking to receive these requests (https://www.securityweek.com/ldap-attack-vector-makes-terabit-scale-ddos-attacks-possible).
