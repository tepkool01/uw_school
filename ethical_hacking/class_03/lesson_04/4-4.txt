Assignment: Basic User Scenario in Kerberos

A user logs onto a workstation and opens a network file share in a Kerberos environment. Explain in detail what happens in Kerberos during this scenario. Which Kerberos "exchanges" take place as part of this scenario?

1. [Authentication/Prove membership on domain] Client requests TGT from KDC (using user's password)
    - KDC Server decrypts request (with user's password it has stored), responds with TGT (encrytped with user's password)
    - If client can decrypt the traffic, the KDC they talked to is legitament.
2. [Establish trust relationship between client and service] Client requests ticket from TGS (Ticket Granting Server) for a specific resource (i.e. Network File Share), using their TGT
    - TGS responds back to client with 'service ticket' they created, which is encrypted with the specific service's (network file share) hash.
3. Client sends ticket and service request to resource server to perform some action.
    - service can decrypt the data because it was encrypted with the service's encryption
    - access to the network file share is granted
