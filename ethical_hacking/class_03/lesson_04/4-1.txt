Assignment: Fundamental Cryptography in Kerberos

Some key cryptographic concepts used in Kerberos are encryption, signatures, and symmetric cryptography. Explain what Kerberos uses each of these concepts for and why.

Kerberos uses encryption in its exchanges to authenticate and subsequently access resources. All 3 of these concepts seem related, so I'm not sure if I can have a 1-1 match of each concept to its application. In the first exchange, to authenticate a user, a symmetric key is used. This key is the user's password, which the user supplies, and the KDC has a record of in its database. The user uses this password to encrypt their message and send it to the KDC. The KDC verifies the signature by successfully decrypting the message using the user's password. (SIDE NOTE: I wonder how the KDC knows which password to use? I have to imagine some unencrypted information must be sent, i.e. the principal, so it knows which password to use to attempt the decrypt). The KDC responds back to the client with a TGT, which is encrypted using the same user's password. When the user receives the response, they can decrypt it using their password. This is the concept of symmetric cryptography in which both parties share the same secret/private key/etc to encrypt and decrypt messages. This secret key is not passed around, and is likely shared only once (at time of creation or password resets). If the user cannot decrypt the message, the signature verification fails and the KDC system they've been interacting may be illegitament or hold the wrong password.
