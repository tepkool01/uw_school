For each of the 3 categories of attacks discussed in this module (man-in-the-middle, denial of service, spoofing), answer the following questions:


- What types of situations lend themselves to using this particular attack?
MITM: If you want to intercept communication before the device connects to the router/endpoint, you'd position yourself between the router and the victim's computer. This would be valuable for eavesdropping traffic, routing traffic differently, capturing responses, modifying traffic, etc.
DOS: If you wanted to take down a service, make it unavailable to legitament users, or cause a company to incur substantial costs (due to scaling/bandwidth costs/missed sales), you could DOS it. 
SPOOFING: If you wanted to have a white-listed IP or Mac address (on a router). Could also hide your identity. 

- What kind of position on the network do you need in order to execute the attack?
MITM: You'd have to be positioned between the router/AP and the victim. 
DOS: You can be an external actor (not in the network) or in the network. This attack is about overloading the target, but gains notoriety from external bots attacking public systems.
SPOOFING: Similar to DOS, spoofing can be done anywhere. 

- As an attacker, what could you gain by using this type of attack?
MITM: Could see where victims go on the web, what services they use, login information, etc.
DOS: Could disrupt business operations of ecommerce sites, could prevent normal operation of devices/systems and potentially crash them. 
SPOOFING: Could protect your identity, cause unusual circumstances in systems to exploit duplicate addresses/mac addresses, bypass system restrictions from blocking you.
